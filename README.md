# Shitty Unity Guns

Simply the unity project name of the gun system I am currently developing. It's designed in a way where it's really easy to add new weapons. Thanks to the easy to use "Weapon Script" you simply fill in a few values for your weapon, add your animations, and you're done!

Most of the actual code for the project is finished, I am just working on adding some base guns, 1 pistol, 1 melee, 1 shotgun, 1 rifle.

The project currently has ADS, crouching, sprinting, recoil, screenshake and all other things you'd want in a gun game, with leaning coming soon.
